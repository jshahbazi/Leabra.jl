# Leabra.jl

This is the Julia conversion of the old version of the Leabra algorithm written in Matlab by Sergio Verduzco.  The original code be found here: <https://github.com/emer/cemer/tree/master/Matlab>

The initial commits of this are almost an exact conversion, save for implementation of the NXX1 function which is based on the Go code found here: <https://github.com/emer/leabra>

As time goes on, the aim of this project is to make it more Julian and update it to the current version of Leabra.

An example network that can give you an idea of how to use this can be found in *example_network.jl*

# Installation

This code requires Julia 1.8.  It was developed with the beta version, but really its only using *const* for some structs.

It will install the following libraries into the project environment

- Distributions
- LinearAlgebra
- Plots
- Random

Steps to run the example:

- Clone this repo into a directory via `git clone https://github.com/jshahbazi/Leabra.jl`
- Run `cd Leabra.jl`
- Run `julia --project=. -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"`
- Run `julia --project=. example_network.jl`

If you want to view the plots, you can just copy and paste the code into a Jupyter notebook.  Or, you can run it from the Julia shell via these steps:

- Run `julia --project=.`
- From the `julia>` prompt, run: `include("example_network.jl")`
