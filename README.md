# Leabra.jl

This is the Julia conversion of the old version of the Leabra algorithm written in Matlab by Sergio Verduzco.  The original code be found here: https://github.com/emer/cemer/tree/master/Matlab

The initial commits of this are almost an exact conversion, save for implementation of the NXX1 function which is based on the Go code found here: https://github.com/emer/leabra

As time goes on, the aim of this project is to make it more Julian and update it to the current version of Leabra.
